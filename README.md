## ✈️ Create a Flight Booking System Using Python and MySQL

In this project, we’ll build a **Python-based flight booking system** using **MySQL** to manage reservations. The system allows users to search for available flights, make reservations, and handle bookings, while admins can manage flight details. Get ready to manage your airline reservations straight from the terminal! 🚀

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **flight reservation system** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. Users can search for flights, make reservations, process payments, and manage their bookings through a simple command-line interface (CLI). Admins, on the other hand, have the ability to add or remove flights and oversee the system’s operation.

We’ll structure the application with a **repository layer** to manage flight data in **MySQL**, along with a **controller layer** that handles user input and system interaction. The end result is an efficient system that handles all aspects of airline reservations.

### Key Features:

- ✈️ **Search Flights**: Users can search for available flights.
- 💺 **Make Reservations**: Book a flight and manage your bookings.
- 🔧 **Admin Features**: Admins can add, remove, and update flight details.
- 🧑‍💻 **CLI Application**: Interact with the system through a command-line interface.
- 🗄️ **MySQL Integration**: Store and manage flight data using a MySQL database.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language for building the application.
- **MySQL**: Database system for storing flight and reservation data.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Core principle used for structuring the application.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Python Programming
- Database Management (MySQL)

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Search Flights**: Look for available flights with specific criteria.
- **Make Reservations**: Book flights and manage reservations.
- **Admin Controls**: Manage flight information as an admin, including adding or removing flights.
